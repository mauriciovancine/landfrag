# LandFrag: a dataset to investigate the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on biodiversity

## Abstract

*Motivation*. The accelerated and widespread conversion of once continuous ecosystems into fragmented landscapes has driven ecological research to understand the response of biodiversity to local (e.g., fragment size) and landscape (e.g., forest cover and fragmentation) changes. This information has important theoretical and applied implications, but is still far from complete. To improve our understanding of this topic, we compiled a comprehensive and updated database that can be useful for assessing species responses to local and landscape drivers across different taxa and multiple scales.

*Main types of variables contained*. We provide information on the abundance and composition of 9,154 species belonging to different taxonomic groups and the functional traits (morphological, trophic, habitat, and reproductive traits) of 2,424 species in 1,472 forest fragments. We also provide the spatial location and size (hectares) of each fragment, as well as the composition (percent forest cover) and configuration (fragment density, forest edge density, and mean inter-fragment isolation distance) of the surrounding landscape. These landscape metrics were measured in concentric buffers from the center of each study fragment; the buffer size ranged from a radius of 500m to 5,000m, in 500m increments.

*Spatial location and grain*. The dataset includes forest fragments sampled in 121 studies from all continents except Antarctica. Most datasets (77%) are from tropical regions, 17% from temperate regions, and 6% from subtropical regions, and were principally done in America (56% from South America, 11% from North America) and Asia (11%).
Time period and grain. Data were collected between 1994 and 2023, and included spatial information recorded at different spatial scales. 

*Major taxa and level of measurement*. The studied organisms included invertebrates (Arachnida, Insecta, and Gastropoda), vertebrates (Amphibia, Squamata, Aves, and Mammalia), and vascular plants.

*Software format*. The dataset and code are available in the repository XXX and the csv. file can be downloaded at this link ZZZ or in the GitHub https://github.com/mauriciovancine/landfrag.

## Description

Numerous studies have investigated the effects of forest loss and fragmentation on species diversity at local and landscape scales, but they are usually restricted to one biological group. This dataset consolidates studies conducted on a variety of taxa in forest fragments of different sizes embedded in diverse landscapes across the globe. In addition to community composition and species relative abundances, it incorporates the spatial locations of fragments and species functional traits. Data were collected between 1994 and 2023, depending on the study. For each fragment, we measured different buffers to extract landscape composition and configuration metrics.
