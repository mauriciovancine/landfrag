# Data Repository

## Overview

This repository contains 2,916 CSV files, each structured with the same set of columns. These datasets were extracted from the script available in the **[code/](code/)** folder.

## File Structure

All CSV files in this repository share a common structure with the following column names:

- **id**: Unique identifier for each entry. This is the same id from the file landfrag_studies_jun2024_final_version.csv available in the **[data/](data/)** folder 
- **buffer**:  Buffer scale (radius of 200 m to 2,000 m).
- **area_mn**: Mean area of fragments.
- **pland**: Percentage of forest in the landscape.
- **np**: Number of fragments.
- **pd**: Fragment density.
- **enn_mn**: Inter-fragment isolation distance.
- **ai**: Aggregation  index.
- **ed**: Edge density.
- **lpi**: Largest patch index.
- **para_mn**: Perimeter-area ratio.
- **contig_mn**: Contiguity index.
- NOTE: More details about these metrics in the Table 1 of the main manuscript. 

## Usage

These files can be used for testing the effects of landscape metrics on species diversity. Because the species abundance, composition, and traits are available for each **id** (first column), it is possible to match biodiversity and landscape data. 

1. [List specific analyses, if any]
2. [Applications or insights derived from the data]
